# Features Update: Picture Engraver v1.1

## 📊 New Calibration Tools

We have completely overhauled the test grid system to help you get perfect colors on stainless steel.

### 1. Optimized Business Card Test Grid
The default test grid is now optimized for standard 85mm x 55mm business cards:
- **High Density**: 122 unique test points (14 columns × 9 rows).
- **Smart Layout**:
  - **LPI (Lines Per Inch)**: 800 down to 300 (Left to Right).
  - **Frequency**: 40kHz up to 90kHz (Top to Bottom).
- **Smart QR Code**: Located in the bottom-right corner (replacing the low-LPI/high-Freq cells that usually produce poor results).
- **High Contrast QR**: Engraved at 50mm/s & 90% power to ensure readability.

### 2. Enhanced Generator Modal
Click the **Test Grid** button to open the new calibration tools:
- **Custom Limits**: Set your own Frequency (40-150kHz) and LPI ranges.
- **High LPI Mode**: Unlock LPI up to 4000 with a checkbox.
- **Grid Layout**: Customize cell sizes (down to 3mm) and gaps.
- **Engraving Settings**: Adjust base power and speed.
- **Live Preview**: See exactly how many test points you'll get.

### 3. Grid Analyzer (New!)
Upload a photo of your engraved grid to the **"Analyze Grid"** tab:
- **Auto-Detection**: The app reads the QR code to instantly recall the exact settings used.
- **Color Map**: Click interactively on the grid cells to see which Frequency/LPI settings produced that color.
- **Future Ready**: Ready for auto-color-matching in future updates.
